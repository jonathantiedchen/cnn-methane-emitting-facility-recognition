# Multi Class Satellite Image Classification Using CNNs For Methane Emitting Facility Tracking

Machine learning approaches can be used to map methane emissions to their sources and thus the contribution to global warming as suggested by Zhu et al. (2022). Therefore, this project aims to use deep learning techniques to classify satellite images into seven categories – Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), Landfills, Mines, Negative, Processing Plants, Refineries & Terminals, WW Treatment – using a dataset with over 86,000 satellite images (Zhu et al., 2022). This is done by implementing and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as well as using pre-trained models with transfer learning and fine-tuning.

## Data 
The used dataset initially was created to support building a global database of methane emitting infrastructure called Methane Tracking Emissions Reference (METER). This dataset contributes to the tracking of emitted volumes to their sources. It contains a total of 86,599 georeferenced images from the US labeled for the presence or absence of any of the six possible methane emitting facilities
